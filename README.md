# Zendesk Search Demo App
This application is a simple front-end client that performs a search of the JSON provided as part of this homework project.

This app was built with the latest version of Node.js, so running this application locally will require `Node.js 12.14` to be installed on your development machine.

Once dependencies are installed, you may run `npm start` to initialize the development server and access the app by browsing to `localhost:3000`.
